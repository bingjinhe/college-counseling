                <h2 class="major">Background</h2>
                <p>I graduated from Tsinghua University, in Beijing, China with a dual degree in Computer Science and Economics . After
                    receiving a Computer Science master's degree in the United States,
                    I entered the technology industry, working for companies such as Cisco and Amazon, as well as a
                    few startups. I moved to Lexington, MA,
                    so my two sons could attend middle school in an excellent public school system. Although both of my children went to private high schools,
                    I am pretty familiar with the resources and opportunities for developing student growth in both public and private schools.
                </p>

                <p>My older son won the MathCounts national championship in 2013. He graduated from Phillips
                    Exeter Academy in 2017,
                    and is one of very few high school students who entered three US Olympiad Camps (Math, Physics and
                    USACO)。Outside of school, he did additional math and physics research, earning recognition and awards, 
			including qualifying as a Regeneron Science Talent Search finalist and as a Siemens Competition winner. 
			He graduated from Harvard in 2021, with a bachelor’s degree in math and a master degree in computer science. My younger son, 
			who is passionate about computer science and entrepreneurship, founded HackNEHS. It took him time—as well as some trial and error 
			through math and science competitions—to find his focus. He graduated from Phillips Andover, in 2018, and then from the 
			University of Pennsylvania, in 2022, with dual degrees from their engineering college and the Wharton Business School 
			(Management&Technology program), as well as a master’s degree in data statistics.
                    </p>

                <p>Overseeing the educational paths of both of my two sons, as well as dozens of other students, I have accumulated a rich inventory of 
			high school competitions (math, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, writing, economics) and extracurricular research 
			(both after school and during the summer), as well as high-quality program choices in STEM topics, business, and entrepreneurship.
			More recently, I have also been advising students interested in writing, debate, and politics. The wisdom I have gleaned from this 
			important work is that each student’s unique qualities must lead the way. Blindly copying the paths of other high-achievers only 
			leads to nervousness and frustration. </p>

               <p>The creation of an individualized educational journey is a complex undertaking that can reap tremendous rewards. Parents should 
		       encourage their children to explore their own interests and potential, developing a realistic sense of their capabilities and 
		       strengths. Learning critical thinking and decision-making skills enables students to develop and seek out their own true 
		       satisfactions. This will make them stand out among peers who simply jump through hoops and follow leaders. Even though educational
		       planning aims to prepare students for college applications, the ultimate goal is to train students to become independent and
		       confident thinkers who are ready to make a difference in the world. These two goals go hand-in-hand.
                </p>

                <p>As an educational advisor, I focus on each student’s attitude rather than their grades (a determined attitude produces good grades). 
			I work with self-disciplined students and reasonable/realistic parents. Years of experience makes me confident that I can help students 
			learn to challenge themselves, as long as parents and students engage in a trusting relationship with me. With each student’s best
			interest in mind, I will present optimal strategies for enriching and optimizing student achievement. </p>

                <h2 class="major">High School Service</h2>
                <p>(This page is not most up-to-date. If you can read Chinese, please switch to Chinese version.)<br />
		    I work with self-disciplined and motivated high school students, aiming to reach their personal
                    goals, regardless of their academic level. I help students with following items:<br /><br />
			
                   1. curriculum planning for the high school years, including course selection each semester or term and standardized test selection (AP, SAT, ACT, etc.). 
			For students who need extra help with schoolwork, I have excellent partner tutors in all subjects.<br/>
2. club and extracurricular activity selection, based on each student’s interests and strengths. These selections are adjusted 
			throughout the high school years.<br/>
3. out-of-school academic resources, such as competition programs or research mentors for advanced students. This includes preparing 
			students for math, science, writing, research, entrepreneurship, or business competitions. <br/>
4. recommending summer programs. This includes helping students with application essays and communicating with research mentors.<br/>
5. selecting a personal project for long-term work. Personal projects dovetail with student skills and deliver impact to the larger community.<br/>
			This critical item adds strength to the college application.<br/>
6. working with students on execution plans, sometimes leveraging my personal connections. Throughout academic challenges, I help students learn to 
			make choices by evaluating the pros and cons, developing both critical thinking and independent problem-solving skills.
			Several students have shared that they benefited greatly from my counsel in this arena. 

                </p>

                <p>The following two packages are available：<br />

                    1. Advisor Role <br />
                    This package includes meeting with each student once a month, and helping parents provide guidance to their student. I identify areas in need of 
			improvement, based on my own observations. (This does not include item 6, above.) Parents who choose this package know their child well
			and have time to guide them. They are not familiar with beneficial local resources; they need assistance crafting possible growth journeys.
			Students who utilize this package are mature, self-motivated, follow instructions well, and have good time management skills.</p>
                <p>2. Parent Proxy <br />
                    This package includes fully guiding students in all of their academics and activities, as I did my own children, helping them to explore their highest 
			potential. While school is in session, I meet with these students as frequently as once per week. Parents who choose this package do not have time
			to guide their students, or are impeded by language barriers. Students who utilize this package benefit from close monitoring of their academic needs, 
			including help with homework.</p>

			My package includes the following items: <br/>
                    1. recommending research-oriented summer programs, after 11th grade, correlating the program with the student’s interests and 
			intended college major. I also provide assistance and oversight of the student’s summer application materials and essays. 
			(This only applies to new students who started before March who didn't miss summer program deadlines.)<br/>
2. recommending a list of approximately 15 colleges, of varying levels, based on each student’s interests and strengths. <br/>
3 making a plan for visiting colleges, as well as application writing milestones for the summer. <br/>
4. reviewing Common App applications, which include selecting five awards, ten activities, optional uploads, and creating a clear persona in the overall
			portfolio (UC schools, MIT, and Georgetown University don't use the Common App. Oxford and Cambridge Universities also have their 
			own admissions systems. These are included in my services.) <br/>
5. brainstorming essays topics for all schools and maximizing essay topic re-use across applications. <br/>
6. assigning an essay tutor who is responsible for polishing up to ten school essays (the UC system counts as one). Essays are revised many times,
			until the tutor, the student, and I are all satisfied. Important essays will be reviewed by more than one tutor.
			(After writing essays for ten applications, students have all they need for additional college applications.)  <br/>
7. reviewing parent and student questionnaires, which influence recommendation letters. <br/>
8. advising which teachers to use for recommendation letters, and strategies for requesting high-quality letters.<br/>
9. answering all questions, from students and parents, during the application cycle. <br/>
10. advising the selection of optional materials, such as resume, video upload, research abstract, etc.<br/>
11. connecting high school students with college students to gain insider information about a particular school or major.<br/>
12. preparing interview content and rehearsing interviews. <br/>
13. advising students and families about waiting list choices and actions.<br/>

                <p>My college advising has the following strength:<br />
                    1. I have a very strong essay tutor team. These experienced tutors are selected over the past few
                    years who can extract out unique qualities from student activities or life-experience, 
			give concrete suggestions and detailed instructions that students can follow.<br />
                    2. I spend a lot of time helping students learn the best way to request recommendation letters. While most
			college advisors let students do this on their own, I have a set of strategies that influence the content of teacher recommendation 
			letters; this directly contributes to improved chances of admission</p>

	            <h3>Student Feedbacks</h3>
                    <p>1. Having Bingjin as a counselor was a huge relief for me during the college application process. She works on an especially 
			    personal level with her students—I can say with a hundred percent certainty that my essay is unique thanks to countless 
			    brainstorming sessions with Bingjin. Because she has known me for multiple years, she was accepting of my out-of-the box 
			    essay idea which other counselors might have cautioned me against. Bingjin never took over any of my decisions. 
			    She simply pointed out multiple directions and helped me figure out which path was the best for me. Of course, 
			    she also wasn’t afraid to tell me the hard truths I needed to hear. Although it was challenging at the time, Bingjin’s
			    rigorous schedule and goal-oriented approach were invaluable to me. Bingjin helped me craft an application that captures 
			    my true personality, motivations, and ambitions. <br/>
			2. My counselor Bingjin was always on top of things; making sure I was completing my tasks in a timely manner and knowing when 
			    my college deadlines were. My essay tutor was also a great help as coming into admissions, 
			    I had no clue what I was going to write about but after some brainstorming sessions and editing help, I was able to create 
			    and polish up one my most favorite essays I have ever written. Thanks for all the help!<br/>
			3. I have to say that Amy was so magical in editing these UC essays, she made them soooo much better that my jaw literally dropped 
			    when I saw her edits! <br/>
			4. My Essay Tutor is very good at extracting ideas and stories from my looks-trivial activites, definitely helps my essay brainstorming.<br/>
			</p>
		    <h3>Parent Feedbacks</h3>
                    <p>1. Bingjin He was very helpful in our son's college application process. She made the college admission process very stress free 
			    for us. She put my son on the right track to finish his application. I'm very happy with the outcome and would highly
			    recommend her as a counselor.<br/>
		       2. We noticed our daughter was struggling with college application at the end of the summer, even though 
			    we thought we picked the best counselor service for her -- The founder of the company was 
			    frequently quoted for college admission by Wall Street Journal, and her counselor 
			    worked as an admission officer at Brown. However our daughter was not happy. She even cried several times.
I contacted Bingjin to talk to her. After the conversation, we finally saw her smile again. It was no brainer, we switched to Bingjin, 
			    and our daughter was admitted to Wharton early.
Our second daughter was very stubborn. She ran into blockers when writing her main essay. We were not worried about it at all, 
			    because Bingjin had been following her for two years. She was admitted to Dartmouth this year.
We are proud parents for two ivy league daughters and we know who we should say thank you to.<br/>

                <h2 class="major">Third Party Partners</h2>
                <p>I share resources for high-quality freelance partners, who help my students with following needs: <br/><br/>
			1. for all core high school curricula, including English, history, math, biology, chemistry, and physics. <br/>
2. for standardized test preparation, such as AP, SAT or ACT. <br/>
3. for students with extra time outside of schoolwork, I recommend research mentors who guide research in math, computer science, 
			economics, social science or business. These are experienced teachers who have mentored high school students;
			some have mentored students who won research competitions such as STS, ISEF, Yau, etc. <br/>
4. for humanities students, I recommend writing classes or camps,as well as selective writing competitions, including Scholastic, John Locke,
							New York Times, etc. I also recommend self-publishing on media platforms.<br/>
5. for STEM students, I recommend step-by-step enrichment programs in preparation for competitions including the AMC series, USACO, F=MA, etc. 
			For top students aiming for Olympiad level competitions, I pair them with top-notch mentors who have personal experience 
			with US Olympiad camps (some of them even competed in international Olympiads, representing the United States).<br/>
